# Jaffinator-IOT-Project
Jaffinator (Based on Wifi Marauder / CapibaraZero) is a compact device built using an ESP-32 microcontroller, a 2.3-inch TFT LCD
display, a LiPo battery, a TP4056 charging module, and a LoRa module, which together
is a small , low-power, and long-range multi-functional device. Jaffinator is powered by
firmware from the WiFi Marauder platform, allowing it to perform penetration-testing
functions such as WiFi deauthentication attacks, capturing WPA/WPA2 handshakes, and
sniffing probe requests.
Jaffinator helps users understand the vulnerabilities within a network through real-life
monitoring, reliable data transmission and on-device controls. By integrating IoT
technology with network auditing functions, our project provides an accessible, efficient,
and portable solution for WiFi security testing.
Overall, Jaffinator is a device designed to evaluate network security, increase awareness
related to network security and enable proactive security measures overall enhancing the
network’s resilience towards cyber-attacks.
